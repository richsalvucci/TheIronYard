You are creating a module that can be used to take quizzes!

example_questionnaire = [
	{
		question: "Why did the chicken cross the road?",
		answer: "B",
		answer_choices: [
			"To see it's mom",
			"To get to the other side",
			"Because he felt like it",
			"I don't know"
		]
	},
	{...},
	{...}
]

After I'm done taking the quiz, you will tell me how many questions I got right. (Percentage is fine)

- Minimum of 10 questions
- Maximum of 50 questions
